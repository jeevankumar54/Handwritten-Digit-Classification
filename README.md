# Handwritten Digits Classification 🧠✍️

This project demonstrates a basic image classification model trained to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the popular MNIST dataset. The model is built using a simple neural network with TensorFlow and Keras.

## 🧾 Features

- Uses MNIST dataset (60,000 training, 10,000 testing images)
- Neural network with dense layers
- Achieves over 97% accuracy on test data
- Clean visualization of loss and accuracy
- Written in an easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook format

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras 📚
- Matplotlib 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
